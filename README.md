This is an application, that allowes you to create an whole texture pack only from one image!
You only have to download an example texture pack from one of these links (they are safe):

1.21   - (https://texture-packs.com/download/1-21-default-template/)          
1.21.1 - (https://texture-packs.com/download/1-21-1-default-template/)        
1.21.2 - (https://texture-packs.com/download/1-21-3-default-template/)        
1.21.3 - (https://texture-packs.com/download/1-21-3-default-template/)        

After downloading you should remove every other folder then the textures folder and you can go for it, choose a
nice photo of your cat, your dog or a super weird image of your best friend and make an texture pack of it.
